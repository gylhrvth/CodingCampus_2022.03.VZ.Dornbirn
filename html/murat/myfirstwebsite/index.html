                    <p id="Description">Pokémon, electronic game series from
                        Nintendo that
                        debuted in Japan in February 1996 as Pokémon Green and
                        Pokémon Red. The franchise later became wildly popular
                        in the United States and around the world. The series,
                        originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of
                        handheld consoles, was introduced in 1998 to the United
                        States with two titles, known to fans as Red and Blue.
                        In the games, players assume the role of Pokémon
                        trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them
                        to battle other Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most
                        successful video game franchises in the world, second
                        only to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.</p>

                    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                    <p id="History">In 1998, Nintendo spent $25 million
                        promoting Pokémon in
                        the United States in partnership with Hasbro, KFC, and
                        others.[14] Nintendo initially feared that Pokémon was
                        too Japanese for Western tastes but Alfred Kahn, then
                        CEO of 4Kids Entertainment convinced the company
                        otherwise.[15] The one who spotted Pokemon's potential
                        in the United States was Kahn's colleague Thomas
                        Kenney.[16]



                        To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the company released
                        two additional titles for the Nintendo Switch: Pokémon
                        Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, remakes of the
                        Nintendo DS Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, on November
                        19, 2021 and its "premake" Pokémon Legends: Arceus,
                        which was subsequently released on January 28,
                        2022.[23][24]

                        The most recent games in the main series, Pokémon
                        Scarlet and Violet began the ninth and latest generation
                        and will be released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch
                        in late 2022.

                        <h1>POKEMON UNIVERSE</h1>
                        <p id="Universe">Pokémon is set in the fictional Pokemon
                            universe.
                            There are numerous regions that have appeared in the
                            various media of the Pokémon franchise. There are 8
                            main series regions set in the main series games:
                            Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh/Hisui, Unova, Kalos,
                            Alola, and Galar. Each of the eight generations of
                            the main series releases focuses on a new region.
                            Every region consists of several cities and towns
                            that the player must explore in order to overcome
                            many waiting challenges, such as Gyms, Contests and
                            villainous teams. At different locations within each
                            region, the player can find different types of
                            Pokémon, as well as helpful items and characters.
                            Different regions are not accessible from one
                            another at all within a single game, only with the
                            exception of Kanto and Johto being linked together
                            in Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold and
                            SoulSilver versions. There are also regions set in
                            spinoff games and two islands in the Pokémon anime
                            (Orange Islands and Decolore Islands), all still set
                            within the same fictional universe.

                            Each main series region in the Pokémon universe is
                            based on a real world location. The first 4
                            introduced regions (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and
                            Sinnoh/Hisui) are based on parts of Japan, with
                            later regions being based on parts of the United
                            States (New York City is Unova and Hawaii is Alola),
                            France (Kalos), the United Kingdom (Galar), and
                            Spain and Portugal (generation 9 region).[28]</p>

                            properties overseen by
                            the Pokémon Company International are divided
                            roughly by generation. These generations are roughly
                            chronological divisions by release; every several
                            years, when a sequel to the 1996 role-playing video
                            games Pokémon Red and Green is released that
                            features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay
                            concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a
                            new generation of the franchise. The main Pokémon
                            video games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga,
                            and trading card game are all updated with the new
                            Pokémon properties each time a new generation
                            begins.[29] Some Pokémon from the newer games appear
                            in anime episodes or films months, or even years,
                            before the game they were programmed for came out.
                            The first generation began in Japan with Pokémon Red
                            and Green on the Game Boy. As of 2022, there are
                            nine generations of main series video games. The
                            most recent games in the main series, Pokémon
                            Scarlet and Violet began the ninth and latest
                            generation and will be released worldwide for the
                            Nintendo Switch in late 2022.[30</p>
