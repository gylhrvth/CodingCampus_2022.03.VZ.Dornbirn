                    <p id="Description">Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that
                        debuted in Japan in February 1996 as Pokémon Green and
                        Pokémon Red. The franchise later became wildly popular
                        in the United States and around the world. The series,
                        originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of
                        handheld consoles, was introduced in 1998 to the United
                        States with two titles, known to fans as Red and Blue.
                        In the games, players assume the role of Pokémon
                        trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them
                        to battle other Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most
                        successful video game franchises in the world, second
                        only to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.</p>

                    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                    <p id="History">In 1998, Nintendo spent $25 million promoting Pokémon in
                        the United States in partnership with Hasbro, KFC, and
                        others.[14] Nintendo initially feared that Pokémon was
                        too Japanese for Western tastes but Alfred Kahn, then
                        CEO of 4Kids Entertainment convinced the company
                        otherwise.[15] The one who spotted Pokemon's potential
                        in the United States was Kahn's colleague Thomas
                        Kenney.[16]

                        In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed
                        the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced
                        that it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon
                        representation agreement. The Pokémon Company
                        International oversees all Pokémon licensing outside
                        Asia.[17] In 2006, the franchise celebrated its tenth
                        anniversary.[18] In 2016, the Pokémon Company celebrated
                        Pokémon's 20th anniversary by airing an ad during Super
                        Bowl 50 in January and re-releasing the first Pokémon
                        video games 1996 Game Boy games Pokémon Red, Green (only
                        in Japan), and Blue, and the 1998 Game Boy Color game
                        Pokémon Yellow for the Nintendo 3DS on February 26,
                        2016.[19][20] The mobile augmented reality game Pokémon
                        Go was released in July 2016.[21] The first live-action
                        film in the franchise, Pokémon Detective Pikachu, based
                        on the 2018 Nintendo 3DS spin-off game Detective
                        Pikachu, was released in 2019.[22] The eighth generation
                        of core series games began with Pokémon Sword and
                        Shield, released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on
                        November 15, 2019.

                        To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the company released
                        two additional titles for the Nintendo Switch: Pokémon
                        Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, remakes of the
                        Nintendo DS Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, on November
                        19, 2021 and its "premake" Pokémon Legends: Arceus,
                        which was subsequently released on January 28,
                        2022.[23][24]

                        The most recent games in the main series, Pokémon
                        Scarlet and Violet began the ninth and latest generation
                        and will be released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch
                        in late 2022.

                        <h1>POKEMON UNIVERSE</h1>
                        <p id="Universe">Pokémon is set in the fictional Pokemon universe.
                            There are numerous regions that have appeared in the
                            various media of the Pokémon franchise. There are 8
                            main series regions set in the main series games:
                            Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh/Hisui, Unova, Kalos,
                            Alola, and Galar. Each of the eight generations of
                            the main series releases focuses on a new region.
                            Every region consists of several cities and towns
                            that the player must explore in order to overcome
                            many waiting challenges, such as Gyms, Contests and
                            villainous teams. At different locations within each
                            region, the player can find different types of
                            Pokémon, as well as helpful items and characters.
                            Different regions are not accessible from one
                            another at all within a single game, only with the
                            exception of Kanto and Johto being linked together
                            in Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold and
                            SoulSilver versions. There are also regions set in
                            spinoff games and two islands in the Pokémon anime
                            (Orange Islands and Decolore Islands), all still set
                            within the same fictional universe.

                            Each main series region in the Pokémon universe is
                            based on a real world location. The first 4
                            introduced regions (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and
                            Sinnoh/Hisui) are based on parts of Japan, with
                            later regions being based on parts of the United
                            States (New York City is Unova and Hawaii is Alola),
                            France (Kalos), the United Kingdom (Galar), and
                            Spain and Portugal (generation 9 region).[28]</p>

                            and Green on the Game Boy. As of 2022, there are
                            nine generations of main series video games. The
